# HTML

## History

In 1991, Tim Berners-Lee created this markup language to improve communication between himself and his CERN co-workers.
Since then, there have been up to 5 versions, and HTML has become the basis of the internet.

## Semantics

### `<section>`

The `<section>` element defines a generic section in a document, such as list of articles, or any other thematic grouping of content. It helps to organize the content within the page.

### `<header>`

The `<header>` element represents introductory content, usually a group of introductory or navigational aids. It often contains headings, logos, and other elements related to the document's header.

### `<article>`

The `<article>` element is used to represent a relevant self-contained piece of content that could be distributed and reused independently, such as a news article or blog post. It encapsulates content that makes sense on its own.

### `<aside>`

The `<aside>` element is used for content that is tangentially related to the content around it. It's typically used for sidebars or content that is not the primary focus but provides additional information.

### `<footer>`

The `<footer>` element represents the footer of a section or a page. It usually contains metadata, copyright information, links to related documents, or contact information.

### `<h1>` to `<h6>`

These elements (`<h1>`, `<h2>`, `<h3>`, `<h4>`, `<h5>`, `<h6>`) represent headings of different levels. `<h1>` is the highest level, typically used for main headings, while `<h6>` is the lowest level. Headings provide structure and hierarchy to the document.

By incorporating these semantic elements into your HTML5 document, you enhance its structure and make it more accessible and meaningful for both developers and automated systems.
